<h4>Do you have what it takes to be a hero in Business?</h4>
</div>
</div>
<p>JCU, in partnership with Queensland Country Bank, is giving local high school students with a passion and desire to develop a career in business, law or finance the chance to learn from industry experts.</p>
<h4>What to expect?</h4>
<p>From this one-day program youâ€™ll gain unique insights into the professions that funnel into a business, commerce and law career. One of our expert Academics will guide you through the process of creating, exploring and pitching a business opportunity, including the financial and legal implications. JCU Advisors will be on hand to provide information about courses and university life, and a Q&amp;A with local professionals will be an opportunity for students to engage with and hear from professionals within those careers.</p>
<h4>Professor Damian Morgan</h4>
<p>Professor Damian Morgan is highly thought provoking in his methods of teaching and teaches across Project Management, International Business and Corporate Strategy here at JCU. His primary research interest is in human behaviour associated with risk perceptions, and prior to joining academia, Damian worked across fields ranging from sailing instruction to statistician.</p>
